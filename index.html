                    Konjic woodcarving is a craft that came from ordinary people. It originated from a small village in Konjic.
                    People made furniture from wood where they decorated it by carving the wood. Soon, it became symbol of Konjic citizens, 
                    and some of the people started opening companies. Little by little, this style became popular and well known in the world. 
                    Furniture was high quality and prices were good. Then in 2014 UNESCO included it as a World heritage. There is even Konjic style woodcarving. This craft is still very alive
                     in Konjic and well respected in the world.
